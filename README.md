# MERN-Based-Register-Login-WebApp

This is basic Registeration -Login machenism built using MERN concept.
I used external passport library's local strategy to create registeration feature.
You can find the documentation over npmjs. https://www.npmjs.com/package/passport

Note: Into the key.js file you might need to enter your owned MongoDb connection string which you can easily get from your Db server.
